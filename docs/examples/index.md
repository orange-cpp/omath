# Examples

This page links to the repository `examples/` directory which contains runnable example projects (CMake + source).

If you want these examples rendered as documentation pages, we can add Markdown files here or copy selected examples into this `docs/examples/` folder.

For now this index provides a landing page so links in the docs pointing to `examples/` resolve correctly in the site.
