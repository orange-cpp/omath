# UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF CODE OF CONDUCT
_Declaration of Community Rights and Responsibilities_

## Preamble

Whereas the Orange++ community is founded on cooperation, mutual respect and support for the development of open-source software;

Whereas it is essential that all participants can contribute and seek assistance in an environment that is safe, inclusive and free from discrimination and harassment;

Whereas the dignity and equality of all participants, regardless of their traits or background, must be respected and protected;

Now, therefore, this Community Code of Conduct is proclaimed as a common standard of behaviour for all members, contributors and participants in projects led by Orange++ and its official communities.

## Article 6

Enforcement of this Code of Conduct is carried out by Orange++ and/or other core contributors (hereinafter “members”).

Members shall strive to:

1. Act fairly, consistently, and transparently.  
2. Consider the context and severity of each incident.  
3. Maintain a civil and welcoming environment for the community as a whole.

Where appropriate, members may consult individuals with relevant lived experience, particularly when an incident concerns a marginalized group, while preserving confidentiality as required by this Code.

## Article 7

Any participant who believes that a breach of this Code of Conduct has occurred and has not been appropriately addressed may report the incident privately.

Reports may be submitted through any of the following channels:

**E-mail**

- `orange-cpp@yandex.ru`

**Discord**

- `@orange_cpp`

**Telegram**

- `@orange_cpp`

The reporting party’s privacy shall be respected, and reports shall not be shared beyond those responsible for handling them, except where required by law or with the explicit consent of the reporting party.

---

## Article 8

Depending on the nature and severity of the infraction, and taking into account past behaviour, members may apply one or more of the following measures.

**1. Correction / Edit**

Where a message is misleading, poorly worded, or likely to cause misunderstanding, members may:

1. Request that the author clarify or correct the message; or  
2. Edit the message where the platform permits and such action is appropriate and transparent.

**2. Warning / Deletion**

Where a message is inappropriate or in breach of the standards, members may:

1. Issue a public or private warning; and/or  
2. Delete the message.

**3. Mute / Temporary Ban**

Where a participant is repeatedly violating the standards, or where their behaviour is significantly disruptive, members may:

1. Temporarily mute the participant; or  
2. Temporarily suspend or ban the participant from the community.

**4. Permanent Ban**

Where a message is hateful or severely disruptive, or where less serious infractions are repeated despite prior measures, members may permanently ban the participant.

Each case shall be considered individually. The final decision regarding the appropriate measure lies with the members responsible for enforcement.

## Article 9

Reports of misconduct and information regarding enforcement actions shall be handled with care and confidentiality.

The personal data of reporters, witnesses, and involved parties shall not be disclosed to third parties, except:

1. Where such disclosure is required by law; or  
2. Where explicit consent has been given by the person concerned.

The maintainer guarantees that every report will be treated with discretion and respect.

2. This Code of Conduct, insofar as it is applicable.

## Article 11

This Code of Conduct shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with its purpose: to promote a safe, respectful and inclusive community.

The maintainer and core contributors may review and revise this Code of Conduct periodically in light of community needs and experience.

## Article 12

Nothing in this Community Code of Conduct may be interpreted as granting to any maintainer, member, contributor, or participant any right to engage in any activity or to perform any act that aims at undermining, limiting, or destroying the rights, protections, and standards set forth herein.

No rule, policy, custom, or decision within the Orange++ projects or their official communities may be invoked to justify harassment, discrimination, retaliation, or any other conduct contrary to this Code of Conduct.
