## 🎯 Goal

My goal is to provide a space where it is safe for everyone to contribute to,
and get support for, open-source software in a respectful and cooperative
manner.

I value all contributions and want to make this project and its
surrounding community a place for everyone.

As members, contributors, and everyone else who may participate in the
development, I strive to keep the entire experience civil.

## 📜 Standards

Our community standards exist in order to make sure everyone feels comfortable
contributing to the project(s) together.

Our standards are:
- Do not harass, attack, or in any other way discriminate against anyone, including
  for their protected traits, including, but not limited to, sex, religion, race,
  appearance, gender, identity, nationality, sexuality, etc.
- Do not go off-topic, do not post spam.
- Treat everyone with respect.

Examples of breaking each rule respectively include:
- Harassment, bullying or inappropriate jokes about another person.
- Posting distasteful imagery, trolling, or posting things unrelated to the topic at hand.
- Treating someone as worse because of their lack of understanding of an issue.

## ⚡ Enforcement

Enforcement of this CoC is done by Orange++ and/or other core contributors.

I, as the core developer, will strive my best to keep this community civil and
following the standards outlined above.

### 🚩 Reporting incidents

If you believe an incident of breaking these standards has occurred, but nobody has
taken appropriate action, you can privately contact the people responsible for dealing
with such incidents in multiple ways:

***E-Mail***
- `orange-cpp@yandex.ru`

***Discord***
- `@orange_cpp`

***Telegram***
- `@orange_cpp`

I guarantee your privacy and will not share those reports with anyone.

## ⚖️ Enforcement Strategy

Depending on the severity of the infraction, any action from the list below may be applied.
Please keep in mind cases are reviewed on a per-case basis and members are the ultimate
deciding factor in the type of punishment.

If the matter benefited from an outside opinion, a member might reach for more opinions
from people unrelated, however, the final decision regarding the action
to be taken is still up to the member.

For example, if the matter at hand regards a representative of a marginalized group or minority,
the member might ask for a first-hand opinion from another representative of such group.

### ✏️ Correction/Edit

If your message is found to be misleading or poorly worded, a member might
edit your message.

### ⚠️ Warning/Deletion

If your message is found inappropriate, a member might give you a public or private warning,
and/or delete your message.

### 🔇 Mute

If your message is disruptive, or you have been repeatedly violating the standards,
a member might mute (or temporarily ban) you.

### ⛔ Ban

If your message is hateful, very disruptive, or other, less serious infractions are repeated
ignoring previous punishments, a member might ban you permanently.

## 🔎 Scope

This CoC shall apply to all projects ran under the Orange++ lead and all _official_ communities
outside of GitHub.

However, it is worth noting that official communities outside of GitHub might have their own,
additional sets of rules.
